      <p class="page-subheading">At any given time, I am either tinkering with test websites, working on my udemy lessons or working on a side-project. I've built several
      websites up to this point and I plan on building many more well after earning my first web developer job and starting my career. The way I see it, the more things that
      I build, the better I will get. So nothing is going to stop me from letting my imagination and creativity run wild.</p>

      <a class="website-link" href="https://jaredvo18.github.io/cv/">My First Website - Personal Website #1</a>
      <p class="website-details">This website was a lot of fun to put together. Looking back at it, I can definitely see that I have made a lot of progress. This was my
      first official and committed step into the world of web development and I am proud of what I have accomplished since finishing this project.</p>

      <a class="website-link" href="https://jaredvo18.github.io/wholesome-media/index.html">Wholesome Media - My First Side-Project</a>
      <p class="website-details">I built Wholesome Media for the purpose of brightening people's day. Obviously I don't expect it to get enough traffic to make an impact.
      With that being said, I am really proud of how this one turned out and how I managed to get it to look good on mobile without any added effort. It's a simple project, but
      it definitely strengthened my CSS3 skills.</p>

      <a class="website-link" href="https://jaredvo18.github.io/VFL/">VanOeffelen Fantasy League Official Website - Side-Project #2 (Ongoing with semi-regular updates)</a>
      <p class="website-details">This is a website that I built for my fantasy football league. I tried modeling it after the NFL official website and I think it turned
      out well. It took me a few days to build it due to life getting fairly hectic for a week or so. I'm glad I made this one and I especially feel good about it because
      everyone in my fantasy football league loves it and they can't wait for me to add more content to it.</p>
