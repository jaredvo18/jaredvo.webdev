      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I was born on November 27, 1996. I grew up with a younger brother and younger sister and together, we always brought the best out of each other. I graduated high school
      in 2015 and briefly attended college for a few years. Although I never graduated, I gained an arsenal of useful information through my studies of accounting, computer science
      and programming.</p>
      <p>I enjoy many things but above all else, I love spending time with my girlfriend and our pets. Other than that, I like to read, play video games, create small web development projects
      and if the day is nice enough, I like to get outside and play tennis or run with my dog.</p>
