      to display my thoughts and figure out what I need to work on to improve my ability to be the best web developer that I possibly can be. Every night I will
      record what I worked on that day. I will also occasionally write some posts about what I plan to work on in the future.</p>

      <h3>Back From An Awesome Family Christmas!</h3>
      <h4>Sunday, December 27, 2020</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Well I am back from having a wonderful Christmas weekend with my family and my girlfriend's family. We opened presents together on Christmas Eve and spent the day together and then
        we went to each other's parents homes. There was so much love and my heart feels so full. Now it is time to get back into coding and focusing on starting
        my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I got a bit further in my Web Dev Bootcamp. I am working on an Introduction to Bootstrap section. I finished 6 lessons and I definitely learned a lot.
        Among the things that I learned was embedding Bootsrap into my documents, creating grid layouts with columns, how to use and customize containers and buttons and learning
        about this really cool open-source website called 'Font Awesome.' We also reviewed how to use Google Fonts which wasn't really needed for me as I have been implementing that
        into my own projects for a while now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it has been a really productive day and I am proud of what I have accomplished. I look forward to finishing the beginner Bootstrap lessons tomorrow and starting
        the Intermediate lessons.
