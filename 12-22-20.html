      <p class="page-subheading">I decided to record my progress and write about what projects I am currently working on here in my blog. I want to have a physical space
      to display my thoughts and figure out what I need to work on to improve my ability to be the best web developer that I possibly can be. Every night I will
      record what I worked on that day. I will also occasionally write some posts about what I plan to work on in the future.</p>

      <h3>Intermediate CSS3 Section Finished. Started Digital Portfolio.</h3>
      <h4>Tuesday, December 22, 2020</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>Today, I reached another milestone in the 2020 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. I finished "Section 5: Intermediate CSS." This section took me a while due
      to the fact that I branched off and made a couple of side projects to practice what I have learned. Nonetheless, I am very proud of myself for getting this far.
      In the next 2 sections I will be working with Bootstrap 4. As of right now, I don't really know anything about Bootsrap but I am really excited to expand my knowledge
      of Web Development and learn another language.</p>
      <p>After completing Section 5, I decided to create an original Digital Portfolio for myself. That has manifested itself into this website. I am really happy with how
      it has turned out so far and I look forward to continously updating it as I grow my arsenal of skills and projects to display.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I would like to get a lot of things done. Among them is adding the "Contact Me" page to this website, updating my VFL website and starting my Bootstrap 4
      lessons. Overall, this was a productive day and I hope to continue my momentum into tomorrow.</p>
