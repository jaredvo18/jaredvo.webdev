      <p class="page-subheading">That's my motto. By the time I go to bed each day, I want to make sure that I have polished my skills enough so that I can feel confident
        that I have become a better web developer than yesterday. I am constantly growing, consistently studying and working hard to sharpen my skills in order to
        become an outstanding programmer! This webpage highlights all of the major skills that I have obtained since I began my web developer studies.</p>

          <h3 class="skill-title">HTML5</h3>
          <p class="skill-details">I started to learn HTML in 2018 while studying at Grand Rapids Community College. Recently I have started taking an online course on Udemy called the '2020
          Web Development Bootcamp.' This course is taught by Dr. Angela Wu, Founder of 'The App Brewery.' The course is
          fully comprehensive and I continue to learn and improve my skills every day.</p>

          <h3 class="skill-title">CSS3</h3>
          <p class="skill-details">Just as I did with HTML, I first learned CSS at Grand Rapids Community College. Recently my skills have exponentially improved due to the instruction from
            Dr. Angela Wu in the 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I now possess an intermediate level of CSS3 skills and I can confidently style a website to have a pleasing
            aesthetic and a professional look.</p>
